This project predicts the Fire Weather Index (FWI) for the Algerian Forest Fires dataset using a Ridge Regression machine learning model.
FWI is an important metric used to estimate the risk and potential spread of wildfires based on weather and fuel moisture conditions.
The Algerian Forest Fires dataset contains meteorological and environmental features such as: Temperature,Relative Humidity, RH,Wind Speed,Ws,Rain,FFMC,DMC,ISI,Classes,Region
These features were preprocessed and scaled, and a Ridge Regression model was trained to predict the FWI value, helping estimate wildfire danger levels.
